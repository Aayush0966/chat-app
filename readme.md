# Modern Chat App ðŸš€

Hey! This is a simple full-stack chat app built by **Aayush0966** and **QwertyMD**.  
We made this project mainly to learn about WebSockets and real-time communication.

## Features
- Real-time 1:1 and group chat (thanks to WebSockets!)
- User authentication (register/login)
- Send text and image messages
- Message reactions, read receipts, and typing indicators
- Modern, responsive UI (React + Tailwind)
- Built with a Node.js/Express backend and PostgreSQL (via Prisma)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io-client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Other:** Cloudinary (for images), JWT Auth

## Why?
We wanted to get hands-on with WebSockets and real-time features. This project is just for fun and learning!
